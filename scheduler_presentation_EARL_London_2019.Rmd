# What is `{gs}`?
]

--

* **An R package** for recurring calendar events (schedules). 

--

* Functions for:  

  + Creating schedules.
  + Composing schedules.
  + Working with schedules.

--

* **A grammar:**

> A grammar is a framework that lays out the minimal set of independent 
components and a means of composing them to solve a wide range of problems
within a domain.
